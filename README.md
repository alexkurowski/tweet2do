Usage
-----

Follow @actrem bot on twitter, wait few minutes till he follows you back and send him a direct message that will be reminded to you later (with a direct message) and added to your task list.

Use following format: "Buy one carton of milk, and if they have eggs, get six @17.45" — you will receive your reminder at 17:45.

You also can add days and months like this: "@3d-7" — you will receive your reminder in 3 days at 07:00.
